            <h3>Building My Foundation</h3>
            <p>I am currently focused on my studies in Computer Engineering at De La Salle University, building a strong
                foundation in software development and computer systems.</p>
            <p>While I don't have formal work experience yet, I am actively developing my skills through academic
                projects, hands-on laboratory work, and personal coding endeavors.</p>
            <p>I am eager to apply my knowledge in real-world settings and am actively seeking opportunities for
                internships and entry-level positions where I can contribute and continue learning.</p>
